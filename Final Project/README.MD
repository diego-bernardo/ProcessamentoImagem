TITLE: Instance segmentation of lesion in breast X-Ray image


This project aims to develop an application that will detect and segment lesions in X-Ray image of breast using a Deep Learning approach with Mask-RCNN network. 
The main image processing tasks involved in this project will be image segmentation, specifically instance segmentation, that will be applied in medical imaging, X-Ray of breast.
Below an example of input/output image. Our system will receive a breast x-ray image and give as output the image segmented by lesions in the breast.

The images used in this project are obtained from public repository DDSM (Digital Database for Screening Mammography) [http://www.eng.usf.edu/cvprg/Mammography/Database.html]
