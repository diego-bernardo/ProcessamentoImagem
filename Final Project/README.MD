Title: Texture Analysis of Skin Cancer Image

This project aims to develop an analise that will identify different patterns in skin lesions applying texture analysis techniques of image processing in images of skin. This project intend show how to apply image processing in medical imaging field.

Below two example of input image. Our system will receive images with skin lesions and will analise texture in order to identify patterns that differentiate malign and benign lesions.

The images used in this project are obtained from SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification on Kaggle Platform. [https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma- classification]
